Mammun Engine
=============

This is the engine of the amazing game Mammun.
Mammun is a sector based realtime strategy game designed to be played within a standard webbrowser (see Mammun GUI). There is also the possibility to connect this engine to facebook and place games based on this engine there.

Because Mammun Engine is an API based service, you can change the GUI completely and/or use just parts of it.

If you want to set up a game using this engine, please contact me and I will provide you with more details.

I'm also searching for a maintainer of this project.
